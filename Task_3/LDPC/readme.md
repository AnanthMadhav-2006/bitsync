LDPC introduction

Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) Codes are a class of powerful error-correcting codes used to ensure reliable data transmission over noisy communication channels. Originally introduced by Robert Gallager in the 1960s and later rediscovered in the 1990s, LDPC codes are known for their excellent performance close to the Shannon limit.

They are defined by a sparse parity-check matrix, which allows for efficient encoding and decoding using iterative algorithms like belief propagation. Due to their high error-correction capability and low computational complexity, LDPC codes are widely used in modern communication systems such as 5G, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), and satellite communications.
