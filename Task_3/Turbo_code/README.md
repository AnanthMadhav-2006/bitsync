# Turbo Codes

## Introduction

Turbo codes are a class of high-performance forward error correction (FEC) codes developed in the 1990s. They were the first practical codes to closely approach the Shannon limit, which is the theoretical maximum information transfer rate over a noisy channel. Turbo codes revolutionized error correction coding and are widely used in various communication systems including 3G/4G mobile communications, deep space communications, and satellite communications.

The name "Turbo" comes from the iterative feedback decoding algorithm, analogous to the principle of a turbocharger in an engine, where the output is fed back to improve performance.
