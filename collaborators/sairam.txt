 fY|X=x(y) = P(y ≤ Y ≤ y+∆y|x ≤ X ≤x+∆x)
 1. There are 4 blue balls and 6 red balls in a box. Balls are blindly removed one by one. Find the
 probability of the 3rd ball drawn being red. The answer may feel obvious but we cannot forget
 that this probability depends on the previous two draws. Hence try to arrive at the answer using
 only conditional arguments.
 2. Monty Hall Problem: Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three
 doors: Behind one door is a cash prize of 10000 Rs; behind the others, nothing. You pick a door,
 Should you or should you not switch?
 say No. 1, and the host (who knows what’s behind the doors) opens one of the other doors, say
 No. 3, which has nothing behind it. He then says to you, ”Do you want to pick door No. 2?”
 3. Suppose that X and Y have a joint continuous distribution with joint PDF fXY(x,y) =
 e−xwhen0 ≤ y < x <∞ and 0 elsewhere
 • Find the conditional CDF FY/X=k where k is a constant and 0 < k < ∞.
 • Use this to find the conditional PDF
