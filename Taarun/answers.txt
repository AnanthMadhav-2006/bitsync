1. If the channel is too errorsome, then, whatever, we do we may not be able to transmit any meaningful info. Hence, No.
But, we could try to reduce errors, try to recover the original message using error correction codes etc.

2. I have an idea of why my encoding implementation is better in some special case assumptions, i.e, with one to one encoding, a simple straight forward decoder etc.

3. I was able to find the mutual information for my encoding but i don't know how to find channel capacity over all possible pmf's of x exactly.
