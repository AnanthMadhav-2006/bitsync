1. If the channel is too errorsome, then, whatever, we do we may not be able to transmit any meaningful info. Hence, No.
But, we could try to reduce errors, try to recover the original message using error correction codes etc.

2. I have a proof that my encoding implementation in code is the best we could under some special case assumptions, i.e, with one to one encoding, a simple straight forward decoder etc.
Due to time constraints, i have not given that proof here.

3. I was able to find the mutual information for my encoding but i don't know how to find channel capacity over all possible pmf's of x exactly.
